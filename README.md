# AGG-UCB

This is an implementation of the paper "Neural Bandit with Arm Group graph".

To run the AGG-UCB, please refer to "AGG_UCB_Run.py" for details.

Since the XRMB data set is quite large (1 GiB ~), if you want to apply the data set, please download the files from (https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/XRMB_data/full/README). Then, save these two data files in the './Dataset' folder.
